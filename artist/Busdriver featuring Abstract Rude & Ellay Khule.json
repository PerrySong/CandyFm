He has been rapping for over a decade and a half. He started off as a youth freestyling bag rapping with family and friends, which led to a life-time love. Stuck between the streets (gangs) of L.A. and hip hop, hip hop eventually won out.\n\nAlways winning various showcases and talent shows as a youngster, Khule had a knack for curb battling and cipher challenges. Being victorious more times than not, the reputation of the emcee grew.\n\nHowever, hip hop wasn't his only influence. As well as the old skool hip hop influences of Run-D.M.C., Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Chill Rob G, Kane, Kool G Rap, Whodini, Dougie Fresh and Slick Rick, Khule was also into John Coltrane, Quiet Riot, Kraftwerk, Malcolm McLaren , New Wave, Reggae and old skool R&B/soul: he naturally incorporates those music influences into the unmatched patterns and rhythms of his rhyme structure.\n\nIn 1989, a place called the Good Life Caf√© opened and it was where the youth could verbally express themselves in an open mic forum. This is the place where the emcee Ellay Khule really connected and matured lyrically. One reason was the ongoing friendly competition with musical comrades such as Freestyle Fellowship, CVE, Funky Trend, Abstract Tribe Unique , Ahmad, Volume 10, Kurupt, Of Mexican Descent, Jurassic 5, and Busdriver, to name a few. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ellay+Khule\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
