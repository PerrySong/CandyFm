Now, their self-starter Infinity Cat label is looking like a blue-chip stock, while their two-man prog-punk project is shaping up as one of the city's most exciting acts. The proof's in their current CD Castle Storm, a bombardment of two-minute concussion shells; a live show that plays Jake's spastic frenzy off Jamin's atom-brain drumming; and the killer no-frills video for \"Noo Sixties,\" which pushes the edge for how maxi something can get and still be called minimalist. Don't miss 'em, unless you'd rather wait for Spin or MOJO to rubber-stamp them first. It shouldn't be long.\" -JIM RIDLEY\n\nThe brothers have since found fame through other mediums, namely in the co-creation of their 2003 post-punk band, BE YOUR OWN PET, in which both Jake and Jamin were founding members along with Jemina Pearl and Jonas Stein. However, early in the bands career, Jake left to spend a year in Iceland and was replaced by current bassist, Nathan Vasquez. With the recent successes of byoP it is hard to believe that Jeff is the brother's first love, and yet their new LP, Castle Storm presents a welcome reunion and return for the brother's number one project. - excerpt from SUBCULTURE MAGAZINE review of \"Castle Storm\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/JeFF\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
