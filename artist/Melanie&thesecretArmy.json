Her 1969 song \"Bobo's Party\" reached number one in France. Later that year she had a hit in the Netherlands with \"Beautiful People\" before performing at Woodstock. Apparently, she was inspired to write \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)\" by the audience lighting candles during her set; the song became a hit in both Europe and the USA. Her biggest hit in the USA was \"Brand New Key\", also known as \"The Roller Skate Song\". She has been awarded three gold albums. \n\nThree of Melanie's compositions were hits for The New Seekers: \"Look What They've Done to My Song Ma\", \"Beautiful People\", and \"The Nickel Song\".\n\nWith one exception her albums have been produced by her husband, Peter Schekeryk. Her three children - Leilah, Jeordie and Beau-Jarred -are also musicians. Beau-Jarred is a guitarist and accompanies his mother on The 2003 Australian hip-hop track \"The Nosebleed Section\" by The Hilltop Hoods sampled Melanie's \"People in the Front Row\".\n\nIn 2004 Melanie released Paled by Dimmer Light, which is co-produced by Peter and Beau-Jarred Schekeryk.\nIn 2010 the last album co- produced by her now late husband Peter Schekeryj and their son Beau Jarred Schekeryk was released: Ever Since You Never Heard Of Me\n\nMelanie, who became the voice of an era in one magical instant onstage at Woodstock, has been putting the pieces in order.\nPieces of a career, scattered by the winds of experience and assembled again by the force of love into the most personal and brilliant moments of her musical journey.\nMelanie is poised to enlighten new generations about what it means to sing with both passion and eloquence, to write at once with intelligence and emotion, and to inspire through songâ€¦ and nobody does this better than Melanie.\n\nOthers learned this that night at Woodstock, where as a New York kid barely known outside of the coffeehouse circuit in Greenwich Village, she sang her song \"Beautiful People\" and inspired the first panorama of candles and cigarette lighters ever raised at a concert event. That, in turn, moved the young singer to write \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain\"), which sold more than one million copies in 1970 and\nprompted Billboard, Cashbox, Melody Maker, Record World, and Bravo to anoint her\nas female vocalist of the year. Her single \"Brand New Key,\" an infectious romp about\nfreedom and roller skates, topped the charts in 1971.\n\nAnd so her story began.\n\nWith guitar in hand and a talent that combined amazing vocal equipment, disarming\nhumor, and a vibrant engagement with life, she was booked as the first solo pop/rock\nartist ever to appear from the Royal Albert Hall to Carnegie Hall, the Metropolitan\nOpera House, and later opened the New Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the\nSydney Opera House, and in the General Assembly of the United Nations, where she\nwas invited to perform on many occasions as delegates greeted her performances\nwith standing ovations.\n\nThe top television hosts of all time -- Ed Sullivan, Johnny Carson, and Dick Cavett --\nbattled to book her. (After her stunning performance on his show, Sullivan goggled\nthat he had not seen such a \"dedicated and responsive audience since ElvisPresley.\")\nAccolades rolled in, from critics (\"Melanie's cult has long been famous, but it's a cult\nthat's responding to something genuine and powerful -- which is maybe another way\nof saying that this writer counts himself as part of the cult too,\" wrote John Rockwell\nin The New York Times) as well as peers (\"Melanie,\" insisted jazz piano virtuoso\nRoger Kellaway, \"is extraordinary to the point that she could be sitting in front of us in\nthis room and sing something like 'Momma Momma' right to us, and it would just go\nright through your entire being.\")\n\nIn the years that followed Melanie continued to record, continued to tour.\nUNICEF made her its spokesperson; Jimi Hendrix's father introduced her to the\nmultitude assembled for the twentieth anniversary of Woodstock. Her records\ncontinued to sell -- more than eighty million to date. She's had her songs covered by\nsingers as diverse as Cher, Dolly Parton, and Macy Gray. She's raised a family, won\nan Emmy, opened a restaurant, written a musical about Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity\nJaneâ€¦\n\nShe has, in short, lived a rare life. But all of it was just a prelude to what's about to\ncome.\n\n\"For the first time, I'm not afraid to voice exactly what I feel. I used to feel that I didn't\nwant to say too much, but now I can say anything. I feel like a person who's never\nbeen heard. Maybe people think they've heard me, but they never really have. I'm a\nnew artist who is having so much fun with my voice -- a person shouldn't be allowed\nto have so much fun. I'm the woman I wanted to be when I was sixteen and going for\nEdith Piaf. It's me -- I'm back.\"\n\n(Written by Robert L. Doerschuk)\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Melanie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
