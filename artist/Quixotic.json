They released the album emovere in 2007. In their own words: \"Quixotic is a celebration and fusion of art in all its forms, in which each art form and each artist complements and benefits from the others. Quixotic reaches out to a broad audience and moves them through a spectrum of experience, ranging from the melancholy of a single soprano to the primal energy of tribal dance and movement with each component enhanced by atmospheric design, multimedia projections and live music. We believe Quixotic represents art at its most eclectic, and performance at its most dynamic.\"\nhttp://www.cdbaby.com/cd/quixoticsounds\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Quixotic\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
