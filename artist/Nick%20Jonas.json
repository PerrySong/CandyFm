As of May 2009, before the release of Lines, Vines and Trying Times, Nick and his brothers have sold over eight million albums worldwide. He also formed the band Nick Jonas & the Administration, which released its first album \"Who I Am\", on February 2, 2010 in the U.S.\n\nNick Jonas was born in Dallas, Texas, the son of Denise, a former sign language teacher and singer, and Paul Kevin Jonas Sr., a songwriter, musician, and former ordained minister at a Pentecostal Assemblies of God church. He was raised in Wyckoff, New Jersey and home schooled by his mother.\n\nJonas's career started when he was discovered at the age of 6 in a barber shop while his mother was getting her hair cut and was referred to as a professional show business manager. At the age of 7, he began performing on Broadway. He had acted in several plays, including A Christmas Carol (in 2000 as Tiny Tim and Scrooge at eight), Annie Get Your Gun (in 2001 as Little Jake), Beauty and the Beast (in 2002 as Chip), and Les Misérables (in 2003 as Gavroche). After Les Misérables closed, he performed in The Sound of Music (as Kurt) at the Paper Mill Playhouse.\n\nFrom 2005 until now, Nick has acted as one-third of the Jonas Brothers.\n\nHowever, in an October 27, 2009 Myspace blog, Nick and the rest of his brothers confirmed and announced, after much speculation, the solo project of Nick's, called Nick Jonas & The Administration (the \"Administration\" is composed of the former members of The New Power Generation). The brothers state that the group is not parting ways, only that each of them wanted to do something \"that was on [their] hearts.\" The brothers add that they are already planning another world tour as the Jonas Brothers this summer (2010). \n\nNick performed 22 dates with the Administration, from January 2, 2010 to January 30, 2010.\n\n\"Who I Am\" debuted at No. 3 with 82,000 on the Billboard 200.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nick+Jonas\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
