Singaporean and proud to be so.\n\nMany credited the band for reviving the local indie music scene. They’re proud of that, too. After all, it’s for the love of music they started this journey in 2003. It’s a blessing to bring together a group of people who share the same passion and this was what they got - So Much More Inside (2004), Hip City (2006) and their latest effort We Satellites in 2008. Always challenging and exploring new sounds with each new project, their rewards include 3 acclaimed albums, two no.1 hits and numerous top 20s -that showcase their evolution, and a whole lot of fans.\n\nProps to the music channels for believing in and helping Electrico, also know as ECO spread their music beyond our shores and kudos to the band for working their asses off touring the Asian circuit, and flying the Singapore flag at the coveted South By Southwest (SXSW) Festival in Texas in 2007 while spreading some of their magic to Los Angeles at the same time.\n\nElectrico became the first Singapore band to receive a nomination at the 2005 MTV Asia Awards and a second in 2008 which culminated in awards for the Top Local Pop Song (for Runaway) at the 13th annual COMPASS (Composers & Authors Society Of Singapore) awards – the 3rd time in as many years – which also saw Dave taking the honors for the Young Composer of the Year.\n\nWith recognition came responsibility, and the lads gave back- undertaking a community project for troubled teens in the same year. The online single Everybody’s Here - a child of the project.\n\nVeterans in the local music scene, but definitely still learning. It helps that these self-confessed music and stage junkies, are friends before musicians. And perhaps that’s what keeps their sound evolving, adding new dimensions to their music and taking their fans along for the ride.\n\nElectrico are - Dave Tan (vocal & guitar), Desmond Goh (bass guitar) and William Lim Jr (drums).\n\nElectrico’s long anticipated 3rd album, “We Satellites”, is now available in Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines . Visit www.wesatellites.com for more details.\nYou Can Also Purchase The Digital Album At \nhttp://www.wayango.com/electrico/ and \nhttp://www.cdbaby.com/cd/electrico\n\nFor Booking and Enquiries, email to marciatan@mac.com\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Electrico\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
