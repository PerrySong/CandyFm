He has been labeled The Clown Prince of Hip-Hop. His career began in the 1980s. \n\nIn 1992, Biz recorded a song called \"Alone Again,\" but Gilbert O'Sullivan claimed the track featured an unauthorized sample of his hit \"Alone Again (Naturally),\" and served Biz papers. His career was quite damaged from the lawsuit, and Biz ducked out of the harshest glare of the limelight for the remainder of the 1990s. He did do a bit of work with Len, Will Smith and the Beastie Boys. During this time he developed his DJ skills. He could scratch using his prodigious stomach.\n\nIn 2003, Biz began recording again. As of 2008, Biz can be seen on the popular children's' show \"Yo Gabba Gabba\" performing various beat box segments known as \"Biz's Beat of the Day\" where he encourages the kids at home to beat box with him.   He has appeared on numerous tv shows and movies including Men in Black II, The Andy Milonakis Show, Nick Cannon's Wild 'n Out, In Living Color, Fastlane and a RadioShack commercial. In 2005, Biz appeared on VH1's Celebrity Fit Club, and won.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Biz+Markie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
