However, recently he supports other authors, rather than uploading his own original VOCALOID works. As a coproducer or arranger of many hit songs, he is still in a very important position.\n\n2) BAKER was born and raised in Manhattan and has been singing and performing since childhood. Currently living and recording on both coasts, he has always been a fan of pop, even before he planned on making music himself.\n\nDespite his participation in several choirs, accappella groups, and musicals, BAKER’s real musical education came from Z100 radio and listening to everyone from Anthony Kiedis and Madonna to Sting and Chris Martin from a young age. And, after living in different cities over the years such as London, Los Angeles, and Florence, BAKER’s musical tastes have only broadened and his influences quite varied, offering diversified, uptempo pop music that blends everything from techno and trip-hop to big pop ballads and R&B. He’s currently a senior at Harvard.\n\nBAKER began recording in August of 2007 and has already attracted attention for his strong voice and keen pop sensibility. In fact, his career as a solo artist began almost by accident. While living in LA, he found himself going out every night in Hollywood and met his first producer while chatting with DJs at Teddy’s just talking about music. That’s when his Nirvana cover, ‘Heart Shaped Box’, was recorded. The track—blending a hard rock aesthetic with driving dance beats—was met with widespread enthusiasm and acclaim. BAKER’s strong voice, oscillating between baritone and tenor, excited many producers and other musicians. Since then, BAKER has cowritten and/or produced every track since.\n\nAnd there’s more to come. BAKER continues to write and record music as more and more fans discover him. So stay tuned as his ascent into the pop music landscape continues…\n\n- baker is an artist from japan that produces music with synthetic voice 初音ミク.\n\n- Baker (Boston, MA)\nFormed in the musical hotbed that is Steve Lord's basement, there was only one direction this band was headed, and that was straight into the hearts and minds of music enthusiasts.\n\nBlessed with a melodic cacophony that veers away from the standard, formulaic rock song, they drive straight at you with an unabashed zealousness that makes you want to dance and break things at the same time. In the midst of this tornado is Conan Skyrme, James Tracy, Andy Casey, Steve Lord, and Nicole Boudreau.\n\nWhen Baker aren't busy playing shows they can usually be found in a cozy, decrepit practice space concocting a mad symphony of energy and sonic beauty, much to the delight of their ever-growing fan base.\n\nWith a much anticipated debut album nearing completion (due out later this year), their wide array of influences and high-energy live performances has both critics and fans alike raving. The buzz surrounding this band at the moment is simply infectious.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Baker\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
