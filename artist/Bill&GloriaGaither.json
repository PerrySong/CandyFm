He also has Ds (Down syndrome). The band name is one of the words Mr. Gage can write.\n\nThe group provides diverse sounds: art-rock, heavy-metal, acoustic folk-ballads, industrial riffs, etc, and Bill Gage continuously refines and re-works his vocal improvisations.\n\nBILL's approach to songwriting is always in flux. The first album BEATLES CHINESE was shaped by a series of challenges the band gave Bill Gage: first to name the songs he wanted to do, and then to sing them, as the band figured out what to play, and each song was quickly recorded. The backing tracks for BILL's second record BAT MAN were recorded in advance. Bill Gage listened to the tracks, sang over them, and then named the songs (and the record).\n\nLive, the BILL show presents a sonic kaleidoscope of punk, psychedelia, pop, and hard rock, Bill Gage tying it all together using his incredible voice and edge-of-the-seat performance (with theatrical touches like the cape he wears for \"STEVE PEPPER\"). Between songs Mr. Gage chats with the crowd, announcing the next song and letting the audience know they're about to hear something \"REALLY GREAT\". While some of his words are not always clear, his intentions are obvious and the crowd stays right with him. Bill Gage is a mild-mannered gentleman, until he has a mic in his hand: \"LET'S ROCK AND ROLL!\"\n\nThe band includes Daren Follower (drums), Gaylen Moore (bass), and guitarists Eric Morin, Greg Ansin, and Mr. Gage's brother, john. Past members include Paul Desjarlais of Pseudonym (1987-91), Stephin Merritt of The Magnetic Fields (1987), and David M. Curry of Empty House Co√∂perative (1996-2000). BILL are working on a new record. \n\nA jazz-pop band called \"bill\" is from San Diego, California and was possibly started in the 1990s  (information about this bands history is scarce).  The albums of the San Diego \"bill\" are called \"End of the Hits\" and \"Birthday Suit.\"\n\nAnother band called \"Bill\", this one playing \"alternative rock\", are from Mexico City, Mexico. Even fewer pieces of information can be found about this group, but they have professional studio recordings and are playing regularly.\n\nAlso there is a Leamington, UK based 3 piece punk band under the name of Bill. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bill\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
