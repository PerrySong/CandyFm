He enjoyed the sounds of many instruments and played several while playing and taking traditional piano lessons. \nAt the age of eleven he received his first acoustic guitar and fell in love with the sound and feel of that instrument. He took lessons, practiced and played at every opportunity. Like all young aspiring musicians, he learned by emulating many guitar greats and slowly developed his own unique style and techniques. \nSteve began listening to early classic rock and of course had to have an electric guitar and amplifier to play that fantastic music. He went electric and kept practicing, playing, imitating and developing. \nSteve started his first band they named “The Strawberry Jam” and played local schools and parties. They played the songs of The Who, Stones, Led Zeppelin, Hendrix and others. They weren’t great but they had a lot of fun and learned a lot.\nSteve’s best friend’s older brother played guitar and sang in a band. He would hang out with them when he could and watched them practice and play in their basement. He picked up a lot watching and listening to them and jammed with them when they gave him the opportunity. Steve eagerly jumped into a rhythm guitar/background vocal spot and had a blast playing some larger venues. They entered and won the local “Battle of the Bands” competition playing some original and cover songs. This group became the popular local favorite “TAS” and played numerous small and medium size venues throughout the midwest. The band broke up and some years went by but Steve kept playing and writing music. \nSteve spent a couple years writing and recording his own songs and refining his sound. He learned his way around the studio recording, mixing and mastering. He became adept at song writing while constantly refining his vocal and instrumental capabilities. \nSteve wrote about fifty songs and recorded thirty four for his outstanding two disc break out solo debut “Wired for sound”. It consists of his best songs in the style of his favorite music, artists and bands. \nKick back, turn it up and enjoy!\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Riley\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
