Epitaph/Hellcat recording act The Slackers.\n\nAfter leaving the Slackers circa 1999-2000, Mush One became involved in several musical projects in the NYC area, most notably Fireproof (Sister Nancy Meets Fireproof, Jammyland Records/Special Potato, 2002), and the Hungry March Band (On the Waterfront, 2003, and Critical Brass, 2004), as well as the New Orleans-inspired Washington Square Stomperz (later to become the Red Hook Warriorz), and Tunnel One Ska Radio (WNYU 89.1 fm NYC, 8:00pm - 9:00pm EST).\n\nSeveral years later, the sounds of ska again beckoned trumpeter player/songwriter Mush One. While still active in the aforementioned projects, he joined with recent Slackers expatriate Zulu, under the auspices of forming a hard bop jazz group. Beginning with Red Hook Warriorz members Paul Defiglia (upright bass) and Ben Shanley (trombone), the core of the band was formed. The sound of Defiglia’s upright bass and Zulu’s ska drumming was immediately explosive, and the Scorchers were born. With this new musical venture, the Scorchers lean back even deeper into the roots of Jamaican music, with a unique blend of vocal harmonies and scorching instrumentals.\n\nIn addition, the Scorchers feature the debut of vocalist Alicia Williams, daughter of 1940’/1950’s Jamaican big-band vocalist Garland Phinn (of the Sonny Bradshaw Orchestra). This award-winning Jamaican big band helped pave the way for seminal Jamaican instrumentalists such as Roland Alphonso and Lloyd Knibb, who would later form the now-legendary Skatalites.\n\nIf that wasn’t enough, saxophone star El Michels (Sharon Jones + The Dap Kings/El Michels Affair/Soul Fire Records) helped form the core sound of the band, with his popcorn-style breaks. Michels also brought his analog recording skills to the Scorchers debut LP, Stuntin’, on Jump Up Records (2005), which was mixed by John Squicciarino. Stuntin’ clocks in at just under 60 minutes, with 17 strong tunes, including an updated version of Burt Bacharach’s Walk On By, and Bob and Rita Marley’s Play Play Play, and features an impressive 4-person horn section, as well as 3-part female harmonies reminiscent of Motown records, and Rita Marley and the Soulettes.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Scorchers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
