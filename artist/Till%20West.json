In addition to his interest in fashion, he has been managing his own distribution company with the well-known fashion labels Timezone, Southpole, Sir Benni Miles, Rocawear and Two Angle since 1993, he has always been passionate about music. \n\nWhen he bought himself his first, very own, record player in 1990 at the age of 16 he already knew that he wanted to live this passion in its full scope. \n\nHis love of music was always in the foreground. Shortly before he went off on his own bat in the fashion industry, he was introduced to Arndt Meyer-Wegner alias DJ Delicious. The two spent at least as many hours behind their record players as they did in the studio and at scene events. \n\nIt didnâ€™t take long until Till West took care of the sound at respected clubs in Cologne, including Funky Chicken, Apollo, Teatro, Tiefenrausch and the El Divino, with its energetic house sets.\n\nTogether with his long-term friend, DJ Delicious, he released his debut single \"Same Man\" in January 2006. You simply cannot deny the single's success. \n\nTwo months prior to the release the single already made waves not only with DJ celebs such as Pete Tong. The single, \"Same Man\" by Till West & DJ Delicious, which will be launched in February under Phunkwerk and at the same time under Sebastian Ingrosso's \"Refune Label\", is currently running as white label and is making waves with world-wide top DJs 2 months before its launch. \n\nFor weeks the track has been running in Pete Tong's Essential Selection Show on BBC / Radio One and was voted the \"essential tune of the week\". \n\nThe disc is in the disc bags of Roger Sanchez, Tom Novy, Mousse T,  Sharam Jey, Miguel Mateus, David Vendetta, Tune Brothers, David Guetta, Joachim Garraud,  Axwell, Sebastian Ingrosso, Steve Angello, Didier Sinclair, Audiowhores, DJ Noir, Gardeweg, Boris Dlugosch, DJ Disciple and Erick Morillo, who used it as the highlight of the evening at the recent opening of the Pacha New York. \n\nThe driving house number excels through its grooving melody and is a must as club smasher for every party. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Till+West\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
