Members include: Dan Maines (bass), Tim Sult (guitar), Jean-Paul Gaster (drums) and Neil Fallon (vocals, guitar, harmonica). Their recording début was EP Pitchfork (Oct 1991).\n\nEach of Clutch's albums is marked by its own distinct and cohesive sound and the band's musical style may be said to have migrated from hardcore punk to hard rock and blues over the course of their career. Clutch's lyrics, at first angry and serious in tone, had by the time of 1993's Transnational Speedway League become characterized by intelligence, wordplay, and often humour (although comedy is not usually the focus). Their songs make frequent reference to history, mythology, popular culture, and religion. Bam Margera often uses Clutch songs in his MTV show \"Viva La Bam.\" \n\nThe members of Clutch often perform on albums with other bands as well as side projects. JP played drums on Five Horse Johnson's album The Mystery Spot. Neil Fallon sang some backing vocals for Dozer's Beyond Colossal album as well as a side project called The Company Band. The band also has a side band they perform in called The Bakerton Group. The music consists of all instrumental jams with a blues feel to it.\n\nClutch has often performed more than 100 shows per year since their formation. They are managed by Jack Flanagan out of NYC.\n\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Clutch\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
