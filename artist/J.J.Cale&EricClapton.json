Cale's personal style has often been described as \"laid back\".\n\nHis songs have been performed by a number of other musicians including \"After Midnight\" and \"Cocaine\" by Eric Clapton, \"Bringing It Back\" by Kansas, \"Call Me the Breeze\" and \"I Got the Same Old Blues\" by Lynyrd Skynyrd, \"Travelin' Light\" and \"Ride Me High\" by Widespread Panic.\n\nCale was born on December 5, 1938, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Some sources incorrectly give his real name as \"Jean Jacques Cale\". A Sunset Strip nightclub owner employing Cale in the mid-1960s came up with the \"JJ\" moniker to avoid confusion with the Velvet Underground's John Cale[citation needed]. In the 2006 documentary, To Tulsa and Back: On Tour with J.J. Cale, Rocky Frisco tells the same version of the story mentioning the other John Cale but without further detail. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/J.J.Cale\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
