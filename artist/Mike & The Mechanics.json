Backpacked with their own sets of broken tools and musical experiences, The Mechanics set out sail to the landscapes and repertoires explored before them by such giants as Ornette Coleman, Alice Coltrane, Sun Ra, Albert Ayler and their contemporaries in other music and art fields.\n\n\"Are The Mechanics a Jazz combo? The Mechanics don't know. As of yet, The Mechanics have no real memory of their own. What they do know is that they are impatient to check out the mechanics behind those musics that tick their tock. They will do so as they are feathered. In colours, primal and expressive. And what better way to understand something than by breaking it and then trying to fix it.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Mechanics\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
