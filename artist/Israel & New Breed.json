Two EP’s were released this year, the second one entitled “Shadows” was produced by Tommy Olsson (Elusive, Theatre Of Tragedy…). A year of gigs, mayhem and minor scandals followed, and in 2000 they picked up a spot at “Sex.Goth.Electronics”, a collection of fine Norwegian underground music. This year also saw the arrival of Bjarte Langeland into the band, who started off as a bass player, but later picked up the guitar. A couple of years of song writing, rehearsals, the occasional gig, fights and the leaving of Hans Henrik followed, and in 2003 “Pleasure and pain” was released, an album which features the backing vocals of Harald Hovtun (Trains, Reflection). While hugely acclaimed by the critics, the album didn’t do as well as one should hope for, so after a few more years of touring, busts and controversy, the band decides to slow down a bit, and spend some time and energy elsewhere. Kristian joined Elusive, and Bjarte spent some time with garage rockers Midtskillewillie before joining The River Knows. Still, there was always a connection, songs were made and rehearsals took place, so when Gothic Music Records entered the field and wanted to re-release “Pleasure and Pain”, the spark was lit. The old New Breed inspiration is back, new line up-plans are being made and the band is ready to take on the world harder than ever in the future.\n\n2) Based in and spawned by the underground industrialmetal scene of Tokyo, Japan, thier music is a mixture of catchy, crushingly intense metal riffs and a streak of techno. They are a new kind, a new species, a NEW BREED.\n\nThier plans for the future? Bigger.....and even better. \"We want to continue making music that will change the Japanese music scene someday. We don't want to limit ourselves to Japan anymore, \" says lead vocalist, Toyo, \" and we hope that our music will someday find itself in the hands of music lovers around the globe.\"\n\nToyo (Vo)\nTama (Gt, Prog)\nTommie-B (Ba)\nMark (Dr)\n\nZestone Records\n\n3) New Breed is the group of psalmists that travel with Praise and Worship Titan, Israel Houghton.  they Incorporate a blend of African rhythms, rock and soulful beats into modern praise and worship to form a very eclectic, broad base, powerful music experience.\n\n4) The second are a Christian rap duo based out of Boston, Massachusetts and composed of the siblings Rosario (Whose stage name is Macho) and Elsie Ortega. Puerto Rican in heritage and originally from Brooklyn, New York, their diverse origins and upbringings can be heard in the lyrics and production they have for their music. They are also a part of the Tunnel Rats crew based out of California.\n\n5) The first was a little known UK freakbeat combo from the mid-60s on the Decca label, who recorded a song 'Unto Us' that can be found on the Decca compilation The Freakbeat Scene\nNew Breed has released two records under the Uprok label, \"Stop the Music\" (2001) and \"Nine\" (2004)\n\n6) Garage rock band from Sacramento, CA recorded 8/1966. Tim Schmit (vocal, bass), Tom Phillips (guitar), Ron Floegel (guitar), George Hullin (drums). World United single #001. \n\n7) Oi! band from Canada\n\n\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/New+Breed\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
