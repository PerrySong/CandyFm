However, thanks to the industry climate at the time that preferred rappers from the East or West Coast, 8Ball was largely ignored by the mainstream. Still, perseverance resulted in a strong underground following in the southern United States, and he was a legend there by the end of that decade. Traveling throughout the lower half of the country along with MJG, his music absorbed many of the elements of their destinations, perhaps most noticeably Texas and Georgia.\n\nUnlike many of his peers, 8Ball has steered clear of legal and criminal trouble and has stuck to a reliable release schedule. He is currently signed to P. Diddy's Bad Boy label.\n\n\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/8Ball\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
