The two were also romantically involved. Pentz's alias, short for Diplodocus, derives from his childhood fascination with dinosaurs.\n\nAs a DJ, Diplo is characterized by his eclectic, often 80s-oriented mashups, mixtapes, and live sets.

In 2006, he started his own label, Mad Decent, signing Brazilian baile funk group Bonde do Role and DJ Blaqstarr.\n\nDiplo also is one of two DJ comprising the group  Major Lazer. Made up of DJs Diplo and Switch, the two were introduced after working with M.I.A.. \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Diplo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
