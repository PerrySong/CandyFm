Atma has been writing rhymes since his teen years in the early 90’s, refining his talent for almost 2 decades. After a near death experience in 1997 & subsequent years of studying the ’universal path’ of enlightenment and consciousness with eastern philosophy, he began to incorporate his knowledge into rhyme form, having a deep love for the culture of hip-hop and eastern mysticism. He has done shows with many well known artists & is an honorary member of both Wu-Tang and also Lost Children of Babylon. In 2008, Atma started the supergroup \"Masta Buildas\" then in 2011, together with Trust One of Formula Abstract formed \"Jewelz Infinite\"\n\nMore information:\nwww.myspace.com/atmamastabuildas\nhttp://www.revolt-motion.com/\nhttp://www.hiphopug.com/atma.html\n\n2) Atma is Andrei Oliver Brasovean  original from Transylvania (Romania). Starting to produce acid-techno and trance music since 1991 he is one of the pioneers of electronic music in East Europe. In '95-'96 he started to produce goa trance music and to organise small parties.\nIn almost 14 years of electronic music production, Atma played under different project names and different colaborations like:Atma, Atma & R’tur, Ravana, Lunar Asylum, Raving Minds, Andy Hype, Atma & Styx… He had also several releases on different labels: Ov-Silence, Skills Rec, Roton, Sith Rec, Cytopia, Dreamtime Rec,Y.S.E \\Millennium Rec and GeomagneticTV.\nBeside his trance projects, Atma works as a music composer and sound engineer for commercial bands (house, dance, pop, rock, hip hop..) and also as a film music producer, theatre & orchestral arrangements.\n\nMore information:\nhttp://www.myspace.com/atmastudio\nhttp://geomagnetic.tv/artists/Atma.htm\nhttp://www.discogs.com/artist/Atma\n\n3) Gerry first made the transition from banging his basement to moving crowds everywhere in 1999 with a guest appearance at Space in his hometown of Philadelphia. The exposure he gained through his residency at Space, alongside the success of mixtape releases such as Opposition, Subculture, and Tribal Verb vol. II (featuring MC Foxy), helped catapult Atma to the upper echelon of the Philly D & B scene.\n\nMore information:\nhttp://www.myspace.com/atma215\nhttp://www.thedjlist.com/djs/ATMA/\n\n3) Australian born musician, ATMA.\nConceived out of heartache, love, loss and the unwavering notion of silver linings, these songs narrate the unravelling of a hallowed union and the harrowing\nRemedy in Motion is the first release.\nPainstakingly born in a solemn Berlin summer ATMA is the solo project of Jane Arnison. A classically trained composer, musician and sound engineer, ATMA, brings her ethereal voice, suspended over gritty guitar riffs to deliver a new layer to the mosaic of her musical adeptness. Executed with graceful ease, ATMA draws lines through on and over the borders of indie, grunge and dream rock.\n\nhttp://atmamusik.bandcamp.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/ATMA\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
