Further collaborations with Frank Zappa and Billy Cobham came his first venture into the charts with \"Reach for It\" and \"Dukey Stick\". Reverting to his jazz roots his \"Brazilian Love Affair\" album even impressed his jazz critics after many accused him of selling out to pop. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/George+Duke\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
